Installation
------------

You will need to install Qt5 development packages.

In the `gnssview` source directory:

	qmake gnssview.pro
	make

Communicating with a GNSS receiver
----------------------------------
You will need to write a program that communicates with your GNSS receiver and then broadcasts the required information via UDP multicast. There are two sample Perl scripts included with the distribution that demonstrate this.

The format of the UDP packet is successive lines in the format:

	time_stamp,constellation_id,satellite_id,azimuth,elevation,signal_level

where the constellation identifiers are:

	0 Beidou
	1 GPS
	2 Galileo
	3 GLONASS
	4 QZSS
	5 SBAS

Azimuth and elevation must be in decimal degrees. The signal level can be whatever the receiver reports: it is scaled via an entry in the configuration file. The satellite identifier is specified according to the following scheme:

	Beidou   1-32
	GPS      1-37
	Galileo  1-32
	GLONASS  1-24 
	QZSS     1-7
	SBAS     20-40
	
Power management
----------------


On Linuxen+x386, YMMV. With `xset`, the backlight would go off briefly and then come back on my Ubuntu 8.04 system. However, after an update to 12.04 it worked fine.  I also tried `vbetool`, there were occasional freezes of up to 30s before the monitor turned off on one box and segfaults on another box. Unfortunately there is no standard way of controlling the monitor in Linux so you may need to tinker with the code.


Configuration file
------------------

`gnssview` uses a configuration file `gnssview.xml`. The comments in the sample file should be enough to get you going.
The search path for this is `./:~/gnssview:~/.gnssview:/usr/local/share/gnssview:/usr/share/gnssview`
All other paths are explicit.

Known bugs/quirks
-----------------

The power on/power off logic assumes on < off.
